WORD GUESSING GAME
Hangman-style Game: 
      The project implements a Hangman-style word-guessing game where players attempt to guess the letters of a hidden word based on given clues.

GUI using Tkinter: 
      The graphical user interface (GUI) is developed using Python's Tkinter library, providing buttons for playing, exiting, and muting background music, along with entry widgets for player input.

Audio and Image Handling: 
      Additional libraries like Pygame and PIL are utilized for background music playback and background image display, enhancing the visual and auditory experience of the game.

Clues and Word Display: 
      The game presents clues for the word to be guessed and dynamically updates the display to reveal correctly guessed letters while keeping incorrect guesses hidden.

Game Logic and State Management: 
      The code is structured around functions that handle different aspects of the game, such as checking player guesses, managing game states (e.g., win, lose), and displaying relevant messages to the player. Global variables are used to maintain game state and track player progress.
